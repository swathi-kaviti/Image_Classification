# Image_Classification
This project implements an image classification system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. It includes a Flask backend for model inference and a user-friendly frontend to upload images and view predictions.

### Project Structure:

**Model Training:** Jupyter Notebook (cnn_cifar-10.ipynb) for building and training the CNN model.

**Model Saving:** The trained model is saved as cnn_cifar10_model.h5.

**Backend:** Flask API to load the model, handle image uploads, and return predictions.

**Frontend:** HTML and JavaScript interface to upload images and display classification results.

### Technologies Used:

Python (TensorFlow, Keras, Flask)

HTML, CSS


### Dataset:
**CIFAR-10:** A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class (e.g., airplane, car, bird, cat, etc.).
